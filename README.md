App made using the Django framework, Bootstrap, PostgresSQL, and the YouTube API. The idea of the project is for my app to hold a list of YouTube videos, which have had copyright strikes made against them. The app allows the user to login, create a list of videos (possibly for each YT channel ID), and add videos to that list.

The Django app makes use of Class based forms, and CRUD actions for the videos.

Environment variables are hidden using dotenv, and the whole project in production mode is management from a virtual environment.

[Ongoing project!]
